cocos2d-x-samples
=================

Contains different samples that show how to use cocos2d-x v3.0 with 3rd party libraries:

Available samples:

## LiquidFun

Based on [Box2d](box2d.org), [LiquidFun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/) features particle-based fluid simulation. Game developers can use it for new game mechanics and add realistic physics to game play. Designers can use the library to create beautiful fluid interactive experiences.

We provide 2 samples:

### LiquidFun - Testbed
